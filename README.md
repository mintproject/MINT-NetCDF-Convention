The purpose of this document is to propose a self-describing data format for structured gridded datasets for MINT data catalog and visualization based on the netCDF and the CF convention. 


## Brief summary on NetCDF 
NetCDF (network Common Data Form) is a file format for storing multidimensional scientific data (`variables`) such as pressure, surface temperature, soil moisture content and wind speed. It has been adopted as a standard way to represent scientific data as it facilitates data access. Its main advantages are<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>:
  - self-describing: it includes information about the data it continas so that no external tables are needed to interpret it
  - machine-independent: portable  across different platforms, eg. MacOS, Windows, Linux
  - scalable: a small subset of a large netCDF file can be accessed efficinetly without reading the entire file 
  

We would like to start a discussion on the common convention for structured gridded data for MINT by proposing the following specifications.  We have consulted the Unidata group's [recommendation](#) on the netCDF attributions for data discovery as well as the [CF Conventions](http://cfconventions.org/) and the [ACDD Conventions](https://is.gd/IKZ3CQ). 

The purpose of this specification is to support efficient visualization and data exchange within the MINT project. We welcome your comments, questions, and any suggestions you might have. Please submit your comments [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eT_Z51R4VwVen-qx7XGtNjoHuc2sMlYmmxbi5acumx0/edit?usp=sharing).

# Attribute Convention
Note that the attribute names link to the Unidata definitions, and each element is marked with `M`,`R`,`O`, or `C` 
depedning on our specificationn requirement
  - `M`: Mandatory    
  - `R`: Recommended
  - `O`: Optional
  - `C`: Mandatory under certain conditions
      - eg. If the dataset has a time dimension, `time_coverage_start` field is mandatory. In this case we mark `time_coverage_start` as `C`
      - Similarly, if the dataset has a spatial dimension, `geospatial_bounds_crs` field is mandatory, and will be marked as `C`


1. Global attributes
	 - Where time is specified as an attirubte, the [IOS 8601]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)) standard should be used
	 
 <!--[todo-add datatype column]-->
 
| Attribute | Requirement | Description | Example | 
|:----------|:------------:|:------------|:--------|
 |title    | M | a short description of the dataset||
| summary | R | a paragraph describing the dataset||
| naming_authority | M | the organization that provides the dataset id (below). We recommend using URIs or reverse-DNS naming | edu.isi.workflow
| id | M | UUID as generated by MINT's data catalog system appended by MINT Workflow ID |  |
| keywords | R| a comma separated list of keywords and phrasts||
| comment | O| micellaneous information about the data||
| date_created| M| the date on which the data was created||
| date_modified | M| the date on which this data was last modified | |
| date_issued | R | the date on which this data was formally issued| |
| creator_name | R | the data creator's name | |
| creator_email |M| the email address of the data creator | |
| institution |R| institution in charge of the dataset | | 
| project | R | the scientific project that produced the data | |

If the dataset has a time component, the following extra specifications on temporal coverage of the data are recommended: 

| Attribute | Requirement | Description | Example | 
|:----------|:------------:|:------------|:--------|
|time_coverage_start|C| earliest time in the dataset | |
|time_coverage_end|C| latest time in the dataset | |
|time_coverage_duration|R| temporal range of the dataset| |
|time_coverage_resolution|C| temporal interval between data points| |


If the dataset has a geospatial coordinate variable, the following extra specifications are required/recommended:

| Attribute | Requirement | Description | Example | 
|:----------|:------------:|:------------|:--------|
| geospatial_bounds_crs | C |||
| geospatial_lat_min | C | a short description of the dataset||
| geospatial_lat_max | C | a paragraph describing the dataset||
| geospatial_lon_min | C | dataset id ||
| geospatial_lon_min | C | dataset id ||
| geospatial_bounds | R | (lon_min, lat_min, lon_max, lat_max||





2. Variable attributes

| Attribute | Requirement | Description | Example | 
|:----------|:------------:|:------------|:--------|
| title* | M | a brief description of the dataset| |
| standard_name* | R | a name for the variable from a standard list of names listed in the [Scientific Variables Ontology](http://www.geoscienceontology.org/) |
| long_name* | R | a long descriptive name for the variable ||
| units* | M | units of the data contained by the variable; must be a valid [udunits](https://is.gd/UVgrOm) string| “m” (meter), “km” (kilometer), “degrees_north” (for latitude), “degrees_east” (for longitude), “K” (temperature in Kelvin), “Pa” (pressure in Pascal)
| valid_min| M | |
| valid_max| M | |
| valid_range| M | |
|missing_value | M |
|fill_value  | M | |
